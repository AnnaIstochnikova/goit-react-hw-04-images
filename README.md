# Goit-react-hw-04-images

## Description

This project is a simple image finder application built with React. It allows users to search for images using keywords and displays the results in a grid. The application uses the Pixabay API to fetch images based on the user's input. It has been refactored to leverage the power of React's useState and useEffect hooks, making the code more efficient and maintainable.
